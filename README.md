# Project-Overview

Product Vision: Foodie Fun
Proposal

What problem does your app solve?
Scientists predict the world’s population is expected to go Vegetarian by 2050. Every year we are seeing this industry make great strides into dismantling the dangerous health effects dairy and meat have. Basically being vegan and vegetarian will become even more popular as today’s society is shifting towards being health conscious.
VeganMeets is an app that helps people find and support restaurants that have vegan options.

Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

What is the mission statement?
Features

What features are required for your minimum viable product? 
- As a user, I can create and login to a new account
- As a user, I can add a restaurant that has vegan options (include address, phone, hours of operation, and menu (menu is optional on this step)
- As a user, I can view a page for each restaurant and I can rate it, and add an item (name, description, price) to the menu.
- As a user, I can search for a restaurant in more than one way (name, zip, city, price range, etc. (If you have a UX designer depend on him/her for this.)

What features may you wish to put in a future release?
- As a user, I can add photos to a restaurant’s profile
- As a user, I can share a link to a restaurant on social media
- As a user, I can see restaurants on a map

Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
